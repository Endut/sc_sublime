# SuperCollider for Sublime Text 3

Welcome to SuperCollider for Sublime Text!

The first thing you'll need to do is set up your sclang executable directory:

- Open Preferences -> Package Settings -> SuperCollider -> Settings - User
- change the value in "sc_path" that matches your operating system so that it points to where you have SuperCollider installed
    + On Mac this means *inside* the SuperCollider.app package. You can check this is correct by right/control clicking the app and selecting "Show Package Contents"

## Starting SuperCollider

Menu -> Tools -> SuperCollider -> Start Interpreter

## Options

Check the User settings file above for some options, the ones you may want to play with are

- highlight_post_view: syntax highlighting for the Post window (in group/tab)
- open_post_view_in: this lets you have your post window as a new sublime group, tab, window, or popup panel
- max_post_view_lines: adjust how much post window recall you want.

## Windows and Linux Users

Key commands are disabled by default as I don't have a sensible set of defaults. I very much welcome you to set your own key commands in Preferences -> Package Settings -> SuperCollider -> Key Bindings (User) ->

BUT! All commands are accessible from the Menu -> Tools -> SuperCollider
